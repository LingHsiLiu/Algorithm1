# 149. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

# If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

# Example
# Given array [3,2,3,1,2], return 1.
